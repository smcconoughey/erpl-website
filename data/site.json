  "subtitle": "through the rapid design and test of rocket engines",
  "description": "The Experimental Rocket Propulsion Lab (ERPL) is a student-run organization dedicated to designing, building, and testing experimental rocket engines. Students experience hands-on learning through a wide range of projects spanning solids, liquids, hybrids, and flight controls. Regardless of what area you decide to focus on in the club, we are glad to have you! You don't need any experience to get started and this is a great way to socialize and network.",
  "philosophy": "ERPL emphasizes iterative development, extensive testing, and post-test data analysis. Every new test is preceded by design reviews, fault analysis, and procedural rehearsals. Test data directly drives iteration decisions across propulsion, fluids, electronics, and structures.",
  "mission": "ERPL exists to bridge the gap between classroom theory and real propulsion systems. Students graduate having designed hardware, executed test campaigns, and analyzed real engine data; experience rarely available at the undergraduate level.",
  "joinLink": "https://campusgroups.erau.edu/erpl/club_signup",
  "whatsNext": "The Experimental Rocket Propulsion Lab is working towards their first flight-capable liquid bi-propellant launch vehicle with the objective of fielding a flight-ready liquid bipropellant vehicle and competing in the Friends of Amateur Rocketry Dollar-Per-Foot Challenge this May."
